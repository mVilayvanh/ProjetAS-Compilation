SYNOPSIS:

Usage ./tpcc [-options] [file]

tpcas is a syntaxical analyser based on C. It is a sub language that
implements primitive type int and char from C language.

The file field has to also indicate the path to the file.

Exemple:
If a file is located in another sub directory (exemple here with executable
being in bin directory and tests being in test directory containing sub directories)
We have to use .. to be in the upper level and then go down to the correct file

./tpcc ../test/good/test3.tpc

OPTIONS:

-t, --tree : 
    print the respective abstract tree of your current tpc file.
    It is made to have a better understanding of what this syntaxical analyser
    can deal with.

-h, --help :
    helps using this program easier. You can learn how to execute it.
